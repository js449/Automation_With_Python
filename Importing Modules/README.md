## ðŸ“˜ Chapter 3 â€“ Loops

This chapter focuses on using `while` and `for` loops to automate repetitive tasks, and introduces importing external Python modules for additional functionality.

### âœ… Key Concepts Learned
- The `while` loop for repeated execution until a condition becomes false
- Using `break` to exit loops and `continue` to skip to the next iteration
- `for` loops combined with `range()` for controlled iteration
- Nested loops for multi-dimensional problems
- Infinite loops and avoiding them with correct conditions
- **Using `import` to bring in external modules like `random` and `time`**

### ðŸ“¦ Modules Used
- `import time` â€” to pause program execution (`time.sleep()`)
- `import random` â€” to generate random numbers or choices

### ðŸ§ª Exercises Completed
- Countdown timer using `while` + `time.sleep()`
- Random number guessing game using `random.randint()`
- Loop printing patterns with `for` and `range()`
- Retry password input with loop + `break`
- Demonstrated use of `continue` and `pass` in flow control

### ðŸ’¡ What I Found Interesting
- Importing built-in modules opened up cool possibilities (like time delays and randomness)
- `for` + `range(start, stop, step)` is very useful for structured loops
- Learning to avoid infinite loops helped me write cleaner conditions
