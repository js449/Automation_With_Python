## ðŸ“˜ Chapter 5 â€“ Lists and Tuples

This chapter dives into Pythonâ€™s list and tuple data types â€” essential tools for storing, accessing, and manipulating collections of data.

### âœ… Key Concepts Learned

#### ðŸ“‹ Lists
- Creating and modifying lists (`[]`)
- Accessing elements with positive and negative indexes
- Using slices (`list[start:end]`)
- Adding items with `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`
- Removing items with `del`, `remove()`, and `pop()`
- Looping through lists with `for`
- Using the `in` and `not in` operators

#### ðŸ§Š Tuples
- Creating tuples with `()`
- The key difference: **Tuples are immutable**
- When and why to use tuples over lists

#### ðŸ§° Useful Functions and Techniques
- `len()`, `sorted()`, `index()`, `count()`
- Multiple assignment (unpacking values from lists/tuples)
- Copying lists using `copy()` or slicing (`[:]`)
- Nested lists and accessing sub-elements

### ðŸ§ª Exercises Completed
- Grocery shopping list that adds/removes items
- Swapping variable values using tuple unpacking
- Nested list navigation (e.g., matrix-style access)
- List slicing practice with different ranges
- Wrote scripts that convert user input into list data

### ðŸ’¡ What I Found Interesting
- Using negative indexes to access list elements from the end
- Tuple unpacking makes variable assignment cleaner
- Lists are extremely flexible â€” adding/removing elements dynamically is simple
