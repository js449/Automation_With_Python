# if you want to execute a block of code only a certain number of times? 
# You can do this with a for loop statement and the range() function.

# In code, a for statement looks something like for i in range(5): and includes the following:

# The for keyword
# A variable name
# The in keyword
# A call to the range() function with up to three integers passed to it
# A colon
# Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the for clause or for block)


# print('Hello!')
# for i in range(5):
#     print('On this iteration, i is set to ' + str(i))
# print('Goodbye!')

# total = 0
# for num in range(101):
#     total = total + num
# print(total) 


# Arguments to range()

# Some functions can be called with multiple arguments separated by a comma, and range() is one of them.
# This lets you change the integer passed to range() to follow any sequence of integers,
#  including starting at a number other than zero:

#In the given below code,The first argument will be where the for loopâ€™s variable starts, 
# and the second argument will be up to, but not including, the number to stop at:

# for i in range(12, 16):
#     print(i)


# The range() function can also be called with three arguments. 
# The first two arguments will be the start and stop values, 
# and the third will be the step argument. 
# The step is the amount by which the variable is increased after each iteration:

# for i in range(0, 10, 2):
#     print(i)

# The range() function can also be called with a negative step argument,
# which will cause the for loop to count down instead of up:

for i in range(5, -1, -1):
    print(i)
